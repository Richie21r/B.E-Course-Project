The increasing need for effective farm management and animal welfare has driven the development of smart monitoring systems. This research introduces an AI-powered Farm Animal Detection and Monitoring System that integrates advanced technologies like object detection, behavior analysis, and disease detection. The system offers real-time information regarding animal security, behaviour, and health through the use of MobileNet SSD, IoT sensors, and thermal imaging. The project also incorporates machine learning for anomaly detection, enabling early warnings for abnormal activity or health conditions of animals. With features like automated alerts, storing historical data, and smart farming integration, this system aims to revolutionize traditional livestock management practices. The proposed system is validated against existing techniques, demonstrating its accuracy and efficiency in enhancing security in livestock management.
